# MD_Scripts
This is a series of scripts and programs for MD analysis I am trying to break things down into sub folders
- gmx setup - used for the generation of input files etc
- gmx analysis - used for analysis programs after an MD step has been run (and perhaps before moving onto the next one)
- gmx sasa - (to come)
- gmx frame analysis - (to come)
- sasa and pytim - (combining sasa and pytim outputs)
